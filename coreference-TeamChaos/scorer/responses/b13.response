The release means both sides will be asked to submit to arbitration; if one of  <COREF ID="NEW11">the parties</COREF>  refuses, as is expected, a 30-day cooling off period will go into effect, after which <COREF ID="6" REF="46">the Teamsters</COREF> are free to strike.  <COREF ID="NEW17">William Genoese</COREF> , <COREF ID="7" REF="NEW17">head of the airline division of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters</COREF>, said <COREF ID="9" REF="10">he</COREF> was &quot;shocked and surprised&quot; when <COREF ID="10" REF="9">he</COREF> heard late Friday from negotiator Walter Wallace of <COREF ID="11" REF="22">the board</COREF>s plans to release <COREF ID="12" REF="NEW11">the parties</COREF> from <COREF ID="13" REF="77">negotiations</COREF>. At  <COREF ID="NEW21">noon EST today</COREF> , <COREF ID="14" REF="18">the mediation board</COREF> is expected to ask <COREF ID="15" REF="12">both parties</COREF> to submit to <COREF ID="16" REF="71">arbitration</COREF>. As previously reported, <COREF ID="17" REF="20">Pan Am</COREF> had asked <COREF ID="18" REF="14">the National Mediation Board</COREF> to declare an impasse in <COREF ID="19" REF="52">the talks</COREF> in late December. But <COREF ID="20" REF="17">Pan Am</COREF>, sensing progress in <COREF ID="21" REF="2">its</COREF> recent negotiations with the unions, asked <COREF ID="22" REF="24">the board</COREF> to delay acting on <COREF ID="23" REF="64">the company</COREF>s request, a source close to <COREF ID="24" REF="22">the board</COREF> said. Also as previously reported, <COREF ID="25" REF="20">Pan Am</COREF> said last week <COREF ID="26" REF="33">it</COREF> would make &quot;changes in  <COREF ID="NEW30">senior management</COREF> &quot; in exchange for labor-cost concessions of $180 million a year for three years from the unions of its Pan American World Airways unit. <COREF ID="29" REF="34">The agreement</COREF> was reached by  <COREF ID="NEW38">a coalition</COREF>  of four of Pan Ams five unions; <COREF ID="31" REF="46">the Teamsters union</COREF> was part of <COREF ID="32" REF="NEW38">that coalition</COREF> -- but has made it clear recently <COREF ID="33" REF="26">it</COREF> did not necessarily go along with <COREF ID="34" REF="29">the agreement</COREF>. For the past year, <COREF ID="35" REF="32">the coalition</COREF> has been trying to force a restructuring of <COREF ID="36" REF="42">Pan Am</COREF> and <COREF ID="37" REF="NEW30">a change in top management</COREF>. Negotiations have been held with  <COREF ID="NEW46">William T. Coleman</COREF> , <COREF ID="39" REF="NEW46">a Pan Am director and Washington attorney</COREF>. <COREF ID="42" REF="36">Pan Am</COREF>s directors are scheduled to meet tomorrow, <COREF ID="43" REF="34">the deadline set for the unions wage-concession agreement</COREF>. It wasnt immediately clear if <COREF ID="46" REF="51">the Teamsters</COREF>s release might jeopardize <COREF ID="47" REF="34">that agreement</COREF>. Last Saturday, <COREF ID="48" REF="55">Mr. Genoese</COREF> said <COREF ID="49" REF="56">he</COREF> sent a telegram to  <COREF ID="NEW54">Mr. Coleman</COREF>  to announce that <COREF ID="51" REF="46">the Teamsters</COREF> plan to end <COREF ID="52" REF="64">their talks with the company</COREF>. <COREF ID="55" REF="48">Mr. Genoese</COREF> said <COREF ID="56" REF="49">he</COREF> had a &quot;cordial&quot;  <COREF ID="NEW57">initial meeting</COREF>  with Mr. Coleman last Thursday, but made no commitment to provide concessions. &quot;<COREF ID="58" REF="NEW57">That meeting</COREF> made it clear to <COREF ID="59" REF="NEW54">Mr. Coleman</COREF> that <COREF ID="60" REF="51">the Teamsters</COREF> and <COREF ID="61" REF="67">Pan Am</COREF> are still deadlocked,&quot; one source close to <COREF ID="62" REF="76">the negotiations</COREF> said. &quot;As far as <COREF ID="63" REF="66">we</COREF>re concerned, <COREF ID="64" REF="23">the company</COREF> triggered this,&quot; <COREF ID="65" REF="55">Mr. Genoese</COREF> said. &quot;<COREF ID="66" REF="68">We</COREF>re not negotiating any more with <COREF ID="67" REF="72">Pan Am</COREF>. <COREF ID="68" REF="66">We</COREF>re in strike procedure now.&quot; <COREF ID="69" REF="75">The union</COREF> has already indicated <COREF ID="70" REF="78">it</COREF> would not be willing to submit to <COREF ID="71" REF="16">arbitration</COREF>. A <COREF ID="72" REF="67">Pan Am</COREF> spokesman declined to comment. <COREF ID="73" REF="87">The Teamsters</COREF>, which represent about 4,500 ticket agents, reservation agents and clerical workers, have been working under a contract that was negotiated in 1978 and scheduled to be renegotiated in 1981. <COREF ID="74" REF="24">The federal mediation board</COREF> has rejected several earlier requests by <COREF ID="75" REF="69">the union</COREF> to declare <COREF ID="76" REF="62">the negotiations</COREF> deadlocked. Meanwhile, Pan Ams pilots union said <COREF ID="78" REF="70">it</COREF> is preparing to sign an agreement to deliver concessions to the company <COREF ID="81" REF="NEW21">today</COREF>. A pilots union spokesman said the leaders plan to take <COREF ID="83" REF="34">the agreement</COREF> to <COREF ID="84" REF="52">their</COREF> membership for ratification. <COREF ID="85" REF="86">He</COREF> said <COREF ID="86" REF="85">he</COREF> didnt know how <COREF ID="87" REF="73">the Teamsters</COREF> action would affect <COREF ID="88" REF="83">the unions agreement with the company</COREF>. </TXT>
