By  <COREF ID="NEW8">BILL VIRGIN</COREF>  c.1996 Seattle Post-Intelligencer SEATTLE @amp; <COREF ID="NEW10">MD</COREF> ;  <COREF ID="NEW11">The</COREF>  <COREF ID="5">National Transportation Safety Board</COREF> is borrowing <COREF ID="6">a Boeing 737</COREF> from Seattles Museum of  <COREF ID="NEW13">Flight</COREF>  as  <COREF ID="NEW14">part</COREF>  of <COREF ID="9" REF="NEW14">its investigation</COREF> into why a similar jetliner crashed near  <COREF ID="NEW16">Pittsburgh</COREF>  in 1994. <COREF ID="11" REF="NEW8">The museums aircraft</COREF>, ironically enough, was donated by USAir, which operated <COREF ID="13" REF="NEW10">the airplane that crashed</COREF>, killing 132 people on board. <COREF ID="14" REF="NEW11">The board</COREF> is testing the planes rudder controls to learn why <COREF ID="16" REF="NEW13">Flight 427</COREF> suddenly rolled and crashed while on <COREF ID="17">its</COREF> approach to the <COREF ID="18" REF="NEW16">Pittsburgh</COREF> airport Sept. 8, 1994. Aviation safety investigators say a sharp movement of the rudder @amp;MD; <COREF ID="19">the movable vertical piece in the planes tail</COREF> @amp;MD; could have caused <COREF ID="21">the jet</COREF>s deadly roll. NTSB Chairman Jim Hall is to address a briefing on the <COREF ID="23">investigation</COREF> in <COREF ID="24">Seattle</COREF> Thursday, but board spokesman Mike Benson said <COREF ID="26">Hall</COREF> isnt expected to announce any findings. <COREF ID="27">Benson</COREF> said <COREF ID="28">investigators</COREF> are simulating air loads on <COREF ID="29">the 737s rudder</COREF>. ``Its a slow, methodical job since <COREF ID="31">we</COREF> dont have adequate black boxes, <COREF ID="32">he</COREF> said. Newer models of flight data recorders, or ``black boxes, would record the angle of the rudder and the pedal controlling it. But because <COREF ID="37">the plane</COREF> was reduced to debris by the force of <COREF ID="38">the crash</COREF>, and <COREF ID="39">the 737</COREF> was equipped with older-model flight recorders that didnt measure <COREF ID="40" REF="28">such information</COREF>, <COREF ID="41" REF="40">investigators</COREF> are running tests to ``surmise <COREF ID="42" REF="27">rudder and pedal position</COREF>, <COREF ID="43" REF="42">Benson</COREF> said. Installation of <COREF ID="44">improved flight recorders</COREF> was  <COREF ID="NEW55">an official recommendation</COREF>  of <COREF ID="45" REF="NEW55">the board</COREF> after earlier hearings into the <COREF ID="46">Pittsburgh crash</COREF>. <COREF ID="48">Museum of Flight</COREF> spokesman Bill Hayes said <COREF ID="49" REF="37">the plane</COREF>, donated last September, was to be partially dismantled as an exhibit. The <COREF ID="50" REF="3">NTSB</COREF> was looking for <COREF ID="51">an intact plane on which to conduct tests</COREF>, so <COREF ID="53">the museum</COREF> delayed <COREF ID="54" REF="17">its</COREF> plans. <COREF ID="55">The tests</COREF> are being conducted at a Boeing hangar at Boeing Field. No airborne tests are planned. The <COREF ID="57" REF="50">NTSB</COREF> also conducted tests <COREF ID="58">last September</COREF> to determine if wake turbulence from another plane could have contributed to <COREF ID="59">the crash</COREF>. <COREF ID="60" REF="43">Benson</COREF> said those results are still being analyzed.
