Total compensation costs in private industry, including  <COREF ID="NEW10">pay</COREF>  and benefits, rose 3.3% <COREF ID="13" REF="11">last year</COREF> after a 3.2% increase in  <COREF ID="NEW14">1986</COREF> , <COREF ID="14" REF="26">the department</COREF> said. The increase in <COREF ID="15" REF="NEW2">these costs</COREF> had been getting smaller each year since 1981, when <COREF ID="16" REF="58">they</COREF> rose 9.8%, <COREF ID="17" REF="NEW28">the same as in 1980</COREF>. Meanwhile, collective bargaining agreements reached last year called for an average 2.2% wage increase in  <COREF ID="NEW22">the first year</COREF>  of the contract and 2.1% annually over  <COREF ID="NEW25">the life</COREF>  of the pact. The industries surveyed agreed to  <COREF ID="NEW28">the same percentage pay</COREF>  raises when they last reached contract accords, <COREF ID="26" REF="14">the department</COREF> said.  <COREF ID="NEW31">Officials</COREF>  said <COREF ID="27" REF="NEW31">it</COREF>s <COREF ID="28" REF="NEW22">the first time</COREF> since 1982 that current contract settlements didnt provide lower average wage adjustments than the bargaining agreements they replaced. The <COREF ID="34" REF="57">wage</COREF> agreements reached <COREF ID="35" REF="13">last year</COREF> also were higher than the average <COREF ID="36" REF="NEW10">pay</COREF> rises bargained in <COREF ID="37" REF="NEW14">1986</COREF>, when a 1.2% increase in the first contract year and a 1.8% annual increase during <COREF ID="40" REF="NEW25">the life of the settlements</COREF> were the smallest increases recorded during the 20 years <COREF ID="43" REF="51">the Labor Department</COREF> has collected the statistics. <COREF ID="44" REF="50">Department officials</COREF> said <COREF ID="46" REF="34">this years higher wage increases</COREF> dont necessarily indicate a trend. A tighter labor market in the services sector may be part of the reason the compensation increases have leveled off, <COREF ID="50" REF="44">officials</COREF> said. A tighter <COREF ID="51" REF="60">labor</COREF> market would allow employees to demand higher pay and benefits. In its report on major collective bargaining agreements, <COREF ID="53" REF="26">the department</COREF> said that the average increase was reduced by lump-sum payments, which are  <COREF ID="NEW62">one-time payments</COREF>  often made upon a contracts ratification. <COREF ID="56" REF="NEW62">The payments</COREF> often are provided instead of <COREF ID="57" REF="63">wage</COREF> increases, but <COREF ID="58" REF="16">they</COREF>  <COREF ID="NEW65">arent</COREF>  included in <COREF ID="59" REF="NEW65">wages</COREF> and arent used as a base for future increases. About half of the workers covered by big <COREF ID="60" REF="51">labor</COREF> contracts <COREF ID="61" REF="68">last year</COREF> received <COREF ID="62" REF="56">these payments</COREF>. Better-than-average <COREF ID="63" REF="57">wage</COREF> settlements for  <COREF ID="NEW75">construction industry workers</COREF>  -- specifically those in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions -- were largely responsible for stopping the narrowing trend. <COREF ID="64" REF="NEW75">Construction</COREF>  <COREF ID="NEW81">pacts</COREF>  settled in <COREF ID="65" REF="NEW81">1987</COREF> averaged 2.9% increases in  <COREF ID="NEW83">the first contract year</COREF>  and 3.1% annually. All other industries surveyed <COREF ID="68" REF="61">last year</COREF>, including the automobile, food store and steel industries, averaged 2.1% increases in <COREF ID="69" REF="NEW83">the first contract year</COREF> and 1.9% annually. About two million workers were covered by <COREF ID="71" REF="68">agreements reached last year</COREF>. </TXT>
