The possibility of <COREF ID="15">a strike</COREF> comes amid growing signs of a strike among members of the Directors Guild of America, whose talks with the three major networks on a contract to replace an agreement expiring June 30 appear to be stalling. On Tuesday, a federal mediator brought <COREF ID="16">NBC</COREF> and <COREF ID="17" REF="NEW9">the union</COREF> together for the first time since <COREF ID="18" REF="17">the union</COREF>s four-year contract expired March 31. Both sides were deadlocked. Areas of dispute include use of temporary workers at <COREF ID="19" REF="16">NBC</COREF>, the length of the new contract and use of non-network news services. </TXT>
