LOUIS <COREF ID="2">The United Steelworkers union</COREF> agreed yesterday to open <COREF ID="3" REF="26">early contract talks</COREF> Aug. 9 with <COREF ID="4" REF="NEW34">the nations two biggest aluminum makers</COREF>. Local presidents, meeting <COREF ID="6">here</COREF>, voted to begin <COREF ID="7" REF="26">the early bargaining</COREF> in an effort to roll back concessions granted in  <COREF ID="NEW10">1986</COREF> . The current pacts with Aluminum Co. of America and Reynolds Metals Co. expire next May 31, and any new accord would supersede that one. &quot;When we negotiated <COREF ID="10" REF="4">the current contracts</COREF> in <COREF ID="11" REF="NEW10">1986</COREF>, our members made sacrifices to help the companies over hard times,&quot; said George Becker, the unions chief negotiator. Since <COREF ID="16">then</COREF>, though, the aluminum industry has staged a strong recovery, and <COREF ID="18">Mr. Becker</COREF> said <COREF ID="19" REF="2">union members</COREF> expect to &quot;share in <COREF ID="21">those gains</COREF> and recover <COREF ID="22" REF="4">the sacrifices they made</COREF>.&quot; Under normal circumstances, bargaining wouldnt have begun until next year.  <COREF ID="NEW23">Pittsburgh-based Alcoa</COREF>  and  <COREF ID="NEW24">Reynolds</COREF> , Richmond, Va., have agreed to <COREF ID="26" REF="3">the early talks</COREF>. The unions action follows a similar decision Friday by the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers union, which bargains in concert with <COREF ID="28" REF="2">the Steelworkers</COREF>. Combined,  <COREF ID="NEW34">the two unions</COREF>  represent about 21,000 <COREF ID="29" REF="NEW23">Alcoa</COREF> and <COREF ID="30" REF="NEW24">Reynolds</COREF> employees. </TXT>
