Schlesinger (WSJ Staff) C LABOR AUT ROCHESTER, Mich. <COREF ID="2" REF="7">Chrysler Corp.</COREF> this year will take the highly unusual step of setting up <COREF ID="3" REF="29">a formal grievance procedure</COREF> for  <COREF ID="NEW10">its non-union white-collar employees.</COREF>  &quot;<COREF ID="6" REF="NEW10">We</COREF> understand that (<COREF ID="7" REF="25">Chrysler</COREF>s) dramatic restructuring . . . will inevitably lead many employees to question managements decisions and actions,&quot; Anthony P. St. John, <COREF ID="8" REF="33">vice president for human resources</COREF> of the auto makers Chrysler Motors subsidiary, said in a speech at  <COREF ID="NEW20">Oakland University</COREF>  <COREF ID="10" REF="NEW20">here</COREF> yesterday. &quot; <COREF ID="NEW22">Employees</COREF>  may not feel that <COREF ID="11" REF="30">they</COREF> are being treated fairly.&quot; To &quot;strengthen <COREF ID="12" REF="NEW97">management</COREF>s credibility,&quot; <COREF ID="13" REF="18">Mr. St. John</COREF> added, <COREF ID="14" REF="37">the company</COREF> will set up <COREF ID="15" REF="44">an &quot;alternative disputes resolution&quot; system</COREF> similar to a traditional union grievance procedure. &quot;For the first time <COREF ID="16" REF="NEW22">these employees</COREF> will be guaranteed <COREF ID="17" REF="3">a formal and impartial internal mechanism</COREF> to resolve discipline, discharge, and employment opportunity disputes,&quot; <COREF ID="18" REF="13">Mr. St. John</COREF> said. <COREF ID="19" REF="NEW2">The process</COREF> will have several steps, concluding with final arbitration handled by a neutral third party. Chryslers move apparently was inspired by the turmoil created by <COREF ID="21" REF="23">its</COREF> current cost-cutting and restructuring, forces which are transforming many industrial companies. <COREF ID="22">The auto maker</COREF> is significantly changing wage and benefit plans, and is trying to slash <COREF ID="23" REF="24">its</COREF> white-collar rolls, particularly in the wake of <COREF ID="24" REF="23">its</COREF> acquisition last year of American Motors Corp. <COREF ID="25" REF="7">Chrysler</COREF> has <COREF ID="26" REF="NEW22">about 31,000 white-collar employees in the U.S.</COREF>, up sharply from roughly 21,000 in 1982. About 6,000 salaried workers are currently represented by the United Auto Workers union. Some analysts speculated <COREF ID="27">the move</COREF> is designed to stave off further union organizing in <COREF ID="28" REF="26">the white-collar ranks</COREF>. Several management consultants said <COREF ID="29" REF="3">a formal grievance procedure with third-party arbitration</COREF> was common for government employees, but <COREF ID="30" REF="11">they</COREF> had never heard of such <COREF ID="31" REF="NEW75">a policy</COREF> for non-union employees at a major private company. &quot;<COREF ID="32" REF="49">It</COREF> has the potential of undermining supervisory and management responsibility and authority,&quot; said Jerrold Bratkovich, <COREF ID="33" REF="8">a vice president</COREF> in the Los Angeles office of the Hay Group, a management consulting firm. &quot;Thats one of the main reasons employers dont want to have unionization.&quot; A Chrysler spokesman said <COREF ID="37" REF="14">the company</COREF> had studied &quot;a couple&quot; of other companies that had <COREF ID="38" REF="NEW22">arbitration for nonunion employees</COREF>, but <COREF ID="39" REF="38">he</COREF> couldnt recall which companies. A more common business approach is the &quot;open-door&quot;  <COREF ID="NEW75">policy such</COREF>  as that at International Business Machines Corp., where &quot;any employee who has a problem which has not been resolved to satisfaction . . . can bring the complaint to the attention of higher management,&quot; said  <COREF ID="NEW86">an IBM spokesman</COREF> . &quot;If the employee is still not satisfied, the problem can be reviewed with the <COREF ID="41" REF="NEW86">IBM</COREF> chief executive officer,&quot; <COREF ID="42" REF="NEW86">the spokesman</COREF> added. <COREF ID="43" REF="46">Chrysler</COREF> will implement <COREF ID="44" REF="15">its system</COREF> later this year. The details havent yet been worked out, <COREF ID="46" REF="43">Chrysler</COREF> said. According to a slide used in <COREF ID="47" REF="18">Mr. St. John</COREF>s presentation, <COREF ID="48" REF="NEW75">the policy</COREF> would cover all &quot;professional, administrative,  <COREF ID="NEW97">management</COREF>  and executive employees.&quot; <COREF ID="49" REF="32">It</COREF> would also have <COREF ID="50" REF="NEW2">a four-step grievance process</COREF>, just as <COREF ID="51" REF="50">UAW</COREF>-represented workers have. </TXT>
