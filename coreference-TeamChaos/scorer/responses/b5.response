Letters to the Editor: Minnesota Isnt Bashing Mediation 06/02/87 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS ( <COREF ID="NEW9">BNK</COREF> )  <COREF ID="NEW10">I</COREF>  was pleased to see your May 5 article, &quot;Farm-Debt Mediation Catches On in  <COREF ID="NEW14">Iowa</COREF> .&quot; <COREF ID="5" REF="NEW9">Farm-debt mediation</COREF> is, indeed, a Farm Belt success story in the midst of the most devastating crash in the farm economy since  <COREF ID="NEW19">the Great Depression</COREF> . <COREF ID="10" REF="NEW10">I</COREF> am compelled, however, to comment on <COREF ID="11" REF="NEW19">your</COREF> evaluation of Minnesotas mediation program. While <COREF ID="14" REF="NEW14">Minnesotas program</COREF> has met some resistance from creditors, <COREF ID="16">it</COREF> nonetheless has been a solid success. As of April 24, there were 3,864 mediations that either have been completed or were in progress. Of the 2,939 completed mediations, 1,393 -- or 46% -- resulted in an agreement.  <COREF ID="NEW35">It</COREF>  is clear from these figures that despite the naysayers, <COREF ID="17">Minnesota mediation</COREF> works. <COREF ID="19" REF="NEW35">It</COREF> helps keep  <COREF ID="NEW41">farmers</COREF>  on the land and <COREF ID="20" REF="NEW41">creditors</COREF> in business. Most important, as the University of Minnesota found when <COREF ID="21" REF="16">it</COREF> evaluated <COREF ID="22">the program</COREF> last winter, <COREF ID="23">mediation</COREF> has reduced significantly the threat of violence in rural areas. Moreover, recent data indicate that <COREF ID="24" REF="23">mediation</COREF> is a viable alternative to bankruptcy. An analysis completed by the Center for  <COREF ID="NEW53">Rural Affairs</COREF>  indicates that states with <COREF ID="25" REF="24">mediation</COREF> have had proportionately fewer Chapter 12 bankruptcy filings. Of the six Midwestern states surveyed, <COREF ID="26">Minnesota</COREF> had the fewest <COREF ID="27">Chapter 12</COREF> filings per 1,000 farmers. As <COREF ID="28">your article</COREF> notes, the Minnesota Legislature is considering various amendments to the Mediation Act. However, <COREF ID="30" REF="NEW53">the proposed amendments</COREF> are not the result of &quot;<COREF ID="31" REF="25">mediation</COREF>-bashing,&quot; as <COREF ID="32">the article</COREF>  <COREF ID="NEW66">suggests</COREF> . Rather, <COREF ID="33">they</COREF> are the result of a growing consensus that <COREF ID="34" REF="31">mediation</COREF> works and should be improved in order to ensure <COREF ID="35" REF="21">it</COREF> works even better. The programs record speaks for <COREF ID="37">itself</COREF>. <COREF ID="38" REF="19">It</COREF>  <COREF ID="NEW73">demonstrates</COREF>  that <COREF ID="39" REF="NEW73">farmers</COREF> and lenders can work together to solve the challenge created by <COREF ID="40" REF="NEW66">the continuing crisis</COREF> in our nations rural economy. <COREF ID="42">Hubert H.
