Eastern Air Proposes Date For Talks on Pay-Cut Plan 01/23/87 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) LABOR TEX AIRLINES ( <COREF ID="NEW7">AIR</COREF> )  <COREF ID="NEW8">MIAMI</COREF>  <COREF ID="3">Eastern Airlines</COREF>  <COREF ID="NEW9">executives</COREF>  notified union leaders that  <COREF ID="NEW11">the carrier</COREF>  wishes to discuss selective wage reductions on <COREF ID="6" REF="NEW11">Feb. 3</COREF>. Union representatives who could be reached said <COREF ID="8">they</COREF> hadnt decided whether <COREF ID="9" REF="8">they</COREF> would respond. By proposing <COREF ID="10">a meeting date</COREF>, <COREF ID="11" REF="10">Eastern</COREF> moved one step closer toward reopening  <COREF ID="NEW17">current high-cost contract agreements</COREF>  with <COREF ID="12" REF="NEW17">its unions</COREF>. The proposal to meet  <COREF ID="NEW19">followed an announcement Wednesday</COREF>  in which Philip Bakes, <COREF ID="14" REF="NEW19">Easterns president</COREF>, laid out proposals to cut wages selectively an average of 29%. <COREF ID="18" REF="NEW7">The airline</COREF>s three major labor unions, whose contracts dont expire until years end at the earliest, have vowed to resist the <COREF ID="19" REF="NEW9">cuts</COREF>. Nevertheless, one union official said <COREF ID="20">he</COREF> was intrigued by the brief and polite letter, which was hand-delivered by corporate security officers to <COREF ID="21">the unions</COREF>. According to  <COREF ID="NEW33">Robert Callahan</COREF> , <COREF ID="22" REF="NEW8">president of Easterns flight attendants union</COREF>, the past practice of Easterns parent, Houston-based <COREF ID="25">Texas Air Corp.</COREF>, has involved confrontation and ultimatums to <COREF ID="26">unions</COREF> either to accept <COREF ID="27">the carrier</COREF>s terms or to suffer the consequences -- in this case, perhaps, layoffs. &quot;Yesterdays performance was a departure,&quot; <COREF ID="28" REF="NEW33">Mr. Callahan</COREF> said, citing the invitation to conduct broad negotiations -- and the lack of a deadline imposed by management. &quot;Frankly, <COREF ID="29">it</COREF>s a little mystifying.&quot; </TXT>
