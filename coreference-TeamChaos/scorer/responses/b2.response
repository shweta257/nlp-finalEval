American Airlines Calls for  <COREF ID="NEW3">Mediation</COREF>  In  <COREF ID="NEW4">Its Union Talks</COREF>  --- By Marj Charlier Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 02/09/87 WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)  <COREF ID="NEW7">AMR LABOR AIRLINES</COREF>  ( <COREF ID="NEW8">AIR</COREF> )  <COREF ID="NEW9">Dallas Amr corp</COREF> .s <COREF ID="5" REF="NEW9">American Airlines unit</COREF> said <COREF ID="6">it</COREF> has called for <COREF ID="7" REF="NEW3">federal mediation</COREF> in its contract talks with unions representing its pilots and flight attendants. A spokesman for <COREF ID="14" REF="NEW8">the company</COREF> said <COREF ID="15">American</COREF> officials &quot;felt  <COREF ID="NEW16">talks</COREF>  had reached  <COREF ID="NEW17">a point</COREF>  where <COREF ID="17" REF="NEW17">mediation</COREF> would be helpful.&quot;  <COREF ID="NEW19">Negotiations</COREF>  with <COREF ID="18" REF="NEW16">the pilots</COREF> have been going on for 11 months; talks with <COREF ID="19" REF="NEW4">flight attendants</COREF> began six months ago. The president of the Association of  <COREF ID="NEW25">Professional Flight Attendants</COREF> , which represents Americans more than 10,000 flight attendants, called the request for mediation &quot;premature&quot; and characterized <COREF ID="24" REF="6">it</COREF> as a bargaining tactic that could lead to  <COREF ID="NEW33">a lockout</COREF> . <COREF ID="25" REF="NEW7">Patt gibbs</COREF>, <COREF ID="26" REF="NEW33">president of the association</COREF>, said talks with the company seemed to be progressing well and <COREF ID="29">the call for mediation</COREF> came as a surprise. The major outstanding issue in the negotiations with the flight attendants is <COREF ID="33">a two-tier wage scale</COREF>, in which recent employees salaries increase on a different scale than the salaries of employees who have worked at <COREF ID="34" REF="15">american</COREF> for a longer time. The union wants to narrow the differences between the new scale and the old one. <COREF ID="36">The company</COREF> declined to comment on <COREF ID="37" REF="NEW19">the negotiations</COREF> or the outstanding issues.  <COREF ID="NEW44">Representatives</COREF>  for the 5,400-member Allied Pilots Association didnt return phone calls. Under the Federal Railway Labor Act, if the mediator fails to bring the two sides together and <COREF ID="38" REF="NEW44">the two sides</COREF> dont agree to binding arbitration, a 30-day cooling-off period follows. After <COREF ID="39">that</COREF>, the union can strike or <COREF ID="40" REF="14">the company</COREF> can lock <COREF ID="41" REF="39">the union</COREF> out. <COREF ID="42">Ms. Gibbs</COREF> said that in response to <COREF ID="43" REF="40">the company</COREF>s move, <COREF ID="44">her union</COREF> will be &quot;escalating&quot; <COREF ID="46" REF="NEW25">its</COREF> &quot;corporate campaign&quot; against <COREF ID="47" REF="34">American</COREF> over the next couple of months. In a corporate campaign, a union tries to get a companys financiers, investors, directors and other financial partners to pressure <COREF ID="48" REF="43">the company</COREF> to meet <COREF ID="49">union</COREF> demands. <COREF ID="50">A corporate campaign</COREF>, <COREF ID="51" REF="50">she</COREF> said, appeals to <COREF ID="52">her members</COREF> because &quot;<COREF ID="54" REF="24">it</COREF> is a nice, clean way to take a job action, and <COREF ID="55">our women</COREF> are hired to be nice.&quot; <COREF ID="56" REF="41">the union</COREF> has decided not to strike, <COREF ID="57" REF="51">she</COREF> said. <COREF ID="58">The union</COREF> has hired a number of professional consultants in <COREF ID="59" REF="46">its</COREF> battle with <COREF ID="60" REF="48">the company</COREF>, including Ray Rogers of Corporate Campaign Inc., <COREF ID="61">the New York labor consultant</COREF> who developed the strategy at Geo. A. Hormel @amp; Co.s Austin, Minn., meatpacking plant last year. That campaign, which included a strike, faltered when <COREF ID="63" REF="60">the company</COREF> hired new workers and the International Meatpacking Union wrested control of the local union from <COREF ID="64">Rogers</COREF> supporters. </TXT>
