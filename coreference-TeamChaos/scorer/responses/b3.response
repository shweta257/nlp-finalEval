The <COREF ID="14" REF="NEW6">proposed transaction</COREF> has an indicated value of $1.59 billion.  <COREF ID="NEW24">Carl C. Icahn</COREF> , <COREF ID="15" REF="NEW11">chairman of TWA</COREF>, wouldnt say whether <COREF ID="17">TWA</COREF> would continue its attempt to take over <COREF ID="201" REF="7">USAir</COREF>. <COREF ID="20" REF="NEW24">Mr. Icahn</COREF> disclosed last week that <COREF ID="21" REF="17">TWA</COREF> already had become <COREF ID="22" REF="NEW13">USAirs largest shareholder</COREF>, with a 15% stake as of Friday.  <COREF ID="NEW27">Some Wall Street sources</COREF>  and airline industry analysts said they doubted that <COREF ID="24" REF="20">Mr. Icahn</COREF> would press <COREF ID="25" REF="NEW15">the attempt</COREF> if <COREF ID="26" REF="201">USAir</COREF> buys <COREF ID="27">Piedmont</COREF>. &quot;I dont think (<COREF ID="28" REF="21">TWA</COREF>) has the wherewithal&quot; to buy <COREF ID="29" REF="26">USAir</COREF> and <COREF ID="30" REF="27">Piedmont</COREF> combined, said  <COREF ID="NEW33">Louis Marckesano</COREF> , <COREF ID="31" REF="NEW33">a securities analyst</COREF> at Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. <COREF ID="32">Mr. Marckesano</COREF> said <COREF ID="33" REF="28">TWA</COREF> and <COREF ID="34" REF="24">Mr. Icahn</COREF> would need an estimated $3.5 billion to acquire <COREF ID="35" REF="29">USAir</COREF> once the merger with <COREF ID="36" REF="30">Piedmont</COREF> is completed. But <COREF ID="37" REF="33">TWA</COREF>, as expected, yesterday filed a second application with the Department of Transportation for permission to acquire <COREF ID="205" REF="35">USAir</COREF>.  <COREF ID="NEW37">The</COREF>  <COREF ID="40" REF="NEW37">department</COREF> last week rejected TWAs first application as &quot;deficient&quot; because <COREF ID="42">it</COREF> omitted such important information as the mergers potential impact on competition and pricing. &quot;<COREF ID="43">It</COREF>s a <COREF ID="44">serious application</COREF>,&quot; a <COREF ID="45" REF="40">department</COREF> official said of the <COREF ID="46">new filing</COREF>. Even so, Wall Street and airline industry sources have continued to view TWAs bid for <COREF ID="202" REF="205">USAir</COREF> skeptically, seeing <COREF ID="50" REF="42">it</COREF> as a ploy to pressure <COREF ID="51" REF="202">USAir</COREF> into buying <COREF ID="52" REF="37">TWA</COREF>. That view was supported in a <COREF ID="53">tender-offer</COREF> document filed by <COREF ID="54" REF="51">USAir</COREF> with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in another document filed in court. The filings gave details of  <COREF ID="NEW61">conversations</COREF>  between <COREF ID="55" REF="34">Mr. Icahn</COREF> and Edwin I. Colodny, <COREF ID="56">chairman and chief executive officer</COREF> of <COREF ID="203" REF="54">USAir</COREF>. <COREF ID="58" REF="203">USAir</COREF> said in <COREF ID="59" REF="NEW61">the filings</COREF> that <COREF ID="60" REF="55">Mr. Icahn</COREF> first contacted <COREF ID="61">Mr. Colodny</COREF> last September to discuss the benefits of combining <COREF ID="62" REF="52">TWA</COREF> and <COREF ID="63" REF="58">USAir</COREF> -- either by <COREF ID="64" REF="62">TWA</COREF>s acquisition of <COREF ID="65" REF="63">USAir</COREF>, or <COREF ID="66" REF="65">USAir</COREF>s acquisition of <COREF ID="67" REF="64">TWA</COREF>. On Feb. 21, after the <COREF ID="68" REF="66">USAir</COREF> bid for <COREF ID="69" REF="36">Piedmont</COREF>, <COREF ID="70" REF="60">Mr. Icahn</COREF> again called <COREF ID="71" REF="61">Mr. Colodny</COREF>, according to <COREF ID="72" REF="NEW27">the documents</COREF>. <COREF ID="73" REF="70">Mr. Icahn</COREF>, <COREF ID="74" REF="72">the documents</COREF> said, told <COREF ID="75" REF="71">Mr. Colodny</COREF> that a merger between Piedmont and USAir would put <COREF ID="78" REF="67">TWA</COREF> in a tough competitive position. <COREF ID="79" REF="73">Mr. Icahn</COREF> reportedly said <COREF ID="80">he</COREF> &quot;couldnt watch that happen.&quot; <COREF ID="81" REF="79">Mr. Icahn</COREF> then proposed that <COREF ID="82" REF="68">USAir</COREF> buy <COREF ID="83" REF="78">TWA</COREF>, or that TWA buy <COREF ID="84" REF="82">USAir</COREF>. While <COREF ID="85" REF="81">Mr. Icahn</COREF> is known to have approached several investment bankers in the last week, seeking advice on how to proceed with <COREF ID="86">TWAs offer for USAir</COREF>, Wall Street sources say <COREF ID="89" REF="80">he</COREF> hasnt retained any investment banking firm in connection with <COREF ID="90">the bid</COREF>. Nevertheless, sources close to <COREF ID="91" REF="84">USAir</COREF> and <COREF ID="92" REF="69">Piedmont</COREF> werent willing to claim victory over <COREF ID="93" REF="85">Mr. Icahn</COREF> and <COREF ID="94" REF="83">TWA</COREF>, even though the <COREF ID="95">tender offer for Piedmont</COREF> has begun. &quot;<COREF ID="97">Carl</COREF> is a tenacious fellow,&quot; said a source close to <COREF ID="98" REF="91">USAir</COREF>. &quot;<COREF ID="99">He</COREF> doesnt give up easily and one should never underestimate what <COREF ID="100" REF="89">he</COREF> can or will do.&quot; <COREF ID="101" REF="93">Mr. Icahn</COREF> couldnt be reached for comment. Sources familiar with <COREF ID="102" REF="101">Mr. Icahn</COREF> and <COREF ID="103" REF="94">TWA</COREF> said that, so far, <COREF ID="104">the airline</COREF> is taking a loss on <COREF ID="105" REF="98">USAir</COREF> shares it bought late last week. <COREF ID="106" REF="103">TWA</COREF> is understood to have held a 4.9% stake in <COREF ID="107" REF="105">USAir</COREF> for nearly a year before increasing <COREF ID="108">its</COREF> position to 15% in recent weeks. A source close to <COREF ID="109" REF="102">Mr. Icahn</COREF> said that the latest stake was bought at prices ranging from about $48.50 a share to more than $50 a share. That would indicate that <COREF ID="110" REF="106">TWA</COREF> has taken a loss of more than $5 million on its <COREF ID="111" REF="107">USAir</COREF> shares. <COREF ID="112" REF="110">TWA</COREF> stock closed at $28, down $2.50 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday. <COREF ID="113">The drop</COREF> reduced the market value of the 22 million shares that <COREF ID="114" REF="109">Mr. Icahn</COREF> and an <COREF ID="115">Icahn</COREF>-led investor group hold in <COREF ID="116" REF="112">TWA</COREF> by some $55 million. <COREF ID="117" REF="111">USAir</COREF> stock fell $3.375 to close at $47.75, and <COREF ID="118" REF="92">Piedmont</COREF> declined 62.5 cents to $67.625. Wall Street traders said <COREF ID="119" REF="118">Piedmont</COREF> shares fell partly because of market uncertainty about federal regulatory approval for a <COREF ID="120">merger with USAir</COREF>. But sources close to <COREF ID="122" REF="117">USAir</COREF> said they didnt believe there would be any problem obtaining approval for <COREF ID="123">the merger</COREF> and pointed out that <COREF ID="124">the company</COREF> plans to complete <COREF ID="125">its tender</COREF> Paragraphing Error Sources close to <COREF ID="127" REF="122">USAir</COREF> and <COREF ID="128" REF="119">Piedmont</COREF> conceded that if <COREF ID="129" REF="116">TWA</COREF> is permitted to buy more <COREF ID="130" REF="127">USAir</COREF> shares, it certainly has enough cash, an estimated $900 million, to do so. Of that money, about $150 million is committed to the purchase of USX Corp. shares, in which <COREF ID="131" REF="114">Mr. Icahn</COREF> currently owns an 11.4% stake. <COREF ID="132" REF="129">TWA</COREF> hasnt yet filed documents with the <COREF ID="133">SEC</COREF> in connection with <COREF ID="134" REF="108">its</COREF> <COREF ID="135" REF="130">USAir</COREF> holding, and it isnt known how much of <COREF ID="136" REF="132">TWA</COREF>s money is committed to buying <COREF ID="137" REF="135">USAir</COREF> shares. Separately, in its SEC filing, <COREF ID="140" REF="137">USAir</COREF> disclosed details of <COREF ID="141" REF="134">its</COREF> plans for financing <COREF ID="142">the Piedmont acquisition</COREF>. <COREF ID="144">The company</COREF> said <COREF ID="145" REF="50">it</COREF> received a letter from New York-based Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Friday indicating the <COREF ID="146">bank</COREF>s willingness to provide as much as $500 million for <COREF ID="147">the purchase</COREF>. <COREF ID="148" REF="140">USAir</COREF> said <COREF ID="149">Manufacturers Hanover</COREF> also is willing to act as agent to raise the remainder of the funds. <COREF ID="150" REF="148">USAir</COREF> said <COREF ID="151" REF="145">it</COREF> expects to borrow as much as $2 billion from banks to complete <COREF ID="152">the acquisition</COREF>. <COREF ID="153" REF="43">It</COREF> then plans to refinance the bank loans with proceeds from public or private equity and subordinated debt offerings. <COREF ID="154">The airline</COREF> also said in <COREF ID="155">the filing</COREF> that <COREF ID="156" REF="151">it</COREF> expects to keep <COREF ID="157" REF="128">Piedmont</COREF>s headquarters in Winston-Salem. <COREF ID="158" REF="150">USAir</COREF> said that  <COREF ID="NEW188">William R. Howard</COREF> , <COREF ID="159" REF="NEW188">chairman and chief executive of Piedmont</COREF>, will be elected president of <COREF ID="161" REF="158">USAir</COREF> after <COREF ID="162" REF="123">the merger</COREF> is completed. Lawyers for <COREF ID="163" REF="136">TWA</COREF> and <COREF ID="164" REF="161">USAir</COREF> are due back in court in Pittsburgh this morning to determine whether <COREF ID="165" REF="163">TWA</COREF> can proceed to buy more USAir stock. <COREF ID="167" REF="164">USAir</COREF> has asked <COREF ID="168">the court</COREF> to issue a preliminary injunction, enjoining <COREF ID="169" REF="165">TWA</COREF> from buying <COREF ID="170" REF="NEW12">more USAir shares</COREF> and from interfering with <COREF ID="172">USAirs tender offer for Piedmont stock</COREF>. <COREF ID="175" REF="167">USAir</COREF> argues that <COREF ID="176" REF="131">Mr. Icahn</COREF> and <COREF ID="177" REF="169">TWA</COREF> violated the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act by buying more than $15 million of <COREF ID="178" REF="175">USAir</COREF> stock without first receiving regulatory approvals. <COREF ID="179" REF="178">USAir</COREF> also alleges that <COREF ID="180" REF="176">Mr. Icahn</COREF> and <COREF ID="181" REF="177">TWA</COREF> werent entitled to buy more than 10% of <COREF ID="182" REF="179">USAir</COREF>s stock without first receiving permission from the <COREF ID="183">Transportation Department</COREF>. A lawyer for <COREF ID="184" REF="181">TWA</COREF> and <COREF ID="185" REF="180">Mr. Icahn</COREF>, in an affidavit, denied that <COREF ID="186" REF="184">TWA</COREF> has done anything wrong by buying a 15% stake in <COREF ID="187" REF="182">USAir</COREF>. <COREF ID="188" REF="186">TWA</COREF> says that <COREF ID="189" REF="156">it</COREF> isnt subject to <COREF ID="190">Hart-Scott-Rodino</COREF> regulations and must only seek approval from the <COREF ID="191" REF="183">Transportation Department</COREF>. Lawyers for <COREF ID="192" REF="188">TWA</COREF> said that the voting-trust application they filed with the <COREF ID="193" REF="45">department</COREF> Wednesday allows <COREF ID="194" REF="104">the airline</COREF> to buy <COREF ID="195" REF="187">USAir</COREF> stock while a separate application to acquire control of <COREF ID="196" REF="195">USAir</COREF> is considered. Indeed, <COREF ID="197" REF="192">TWA</COREF> contends that Houston-based Texas Air Corp. bought more than 9.9% of Eastern Airlines -- which <COREF ID="198" REF="189">it</COREF> later acquired entirely -- before the <COREF ID="199" REF="193">department</COREF> approved <COREF ID="200">Texas Air</COREF>s application to create a trust to hold the shares. </TXT>
