In answering questions from members of  <COREF ID="NEW12">the National Strategy Forum</COREF>  <COREF ID="7" REF="NEW12">here</COREF>, <COREF ID="8" REF="12">Mr. Reagan</COREF> said  <COREF ID="NEW13">it</COREF>  is &quot;doubtful&quot; that a strategic arms reduction, or START, treaty could be wrapped up in time. Administration aides have been saying for weeks that there are far too many disagreements remaining for <COREF ID="11" REF="24">a treaty</COREF> to be wrapped up, but <COREF ID="12" REF="14">Mr. Reagan</COREF>s  <COREF ID="NEW23">remarks</COREF>  represented <COREF ID="13" REF="NEW23">his</COREF> bluntest public assessment so far. <COREF ID="14" REF="12">Mr. Reagan</COREF> said that both <COREF ID="15" REF="21">he</COREF> and <COREF ID="16" REF="14">Mr. Gorbachev</COREF> hope that an agreement eliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles, signed at a summit meeting in Washington last December, will be ratified by the Senate in time for <COREF ID="19" REF="NEW8">the Moscow summit</COREF>. But then <COREF ID="21" REF="15">he</COREF> added: &quot;Our desire that <COREF ID="23" REF="27">we</COREF> would be able to sign <COREF ID="24" REF="11">a START treaty</COREF> at <COREF ID="25" REF="NEW8">this Moscow summit</COREF>, as <COREF ID="27" REF="23">we</COREF> did <COREF ID="28" REF="19">the other one at the Washington summit</COREF>, may not happen.&quot; <COREF ID="31" REF="14">Mr. Reagan</COREF> insisted that if such a treaty is ever completed, <COREF ID="32" REF="NEW13">it</COREF> would have to produce &quot;parity&quot; in U.S. and Soviet strategic arsenals. </TXT>
