Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., is seeking steep wage cuts from its roughly 10,000 machinists and baggage handlers as part of a plan to restore <COREF ID="18" REF="NEW108">the ailing carrier</COREF> to profitability, and <COREF ID="19" REF="25">it</COREF> has shrunk <COREF ID="20" REF="37">its</COREF> capacity about 13% in the past year while seeking <COREF ID="21" REF="NEW91">the cost concessions</COREF>. In an interview, <COREF ID="22" REF="29">Mr. Bickford</COREF> acknowledged that the ever-growing clamor of public demonstrations, letter-writing campaigns and political lobbying have heightened antagonism at  <COREF ID="NEW47">the bargaining table</COREF> . &quot;Litigation, charges, counter-charges -- <COREF ID="23" REF="26">I</COREF>m used to that,&quot; said <COREF ID="24" REF="31">Mr. Bickford, an 18-year mediation veteran</COREF>. &quot;But the extent to which <COREF ID="25" REF="27">it</COREF> has gone in this case is unparalleled. <COREF ID="26" REF="23">I</COREF> have never faced anything like <COREF ID="27" REF="25">it</COREF>.&quot; Nevertheless, <COREF ID="28" REF="27">&quot;We</COREF> are still talking,&quot; <COREF ID="29" REF="30">Mr. Bickford</COREF> asserted, &quot;and have been every day since the 26th of January, with the exception of three periods totaling 10 days.&quot; <COREF ID="30" REF="29">Mr. Bickford</COREF> expressed anger at the growing perception that the mediation process was fruitless and futile. Last week, for instance, Florida Gov.  <COREF ID="NEW70">Bob Martinez</COREF>  issued a news release saying that &quot;<COREF ID="31" REF="24">mediation</COREF> has reached a stalemate and both sides should be allowed to return to <COREF ID="32" REF="NEW47">the bargaining table</COREF>.&quot; And for <COREF ID="33" REF="NEW113">their</COREF> part, <COREF ID="34" REF="50">Eastern</COREF> officials continue to lobby for  <COREF ID="NEW76">the National Mediation Board</COREF>  to impose a deadline on <COREF ID="35" REF="74">the talks</COREF>, without which management contends an agreement on a wage-concession package is all but impossible. Under U.S. labor law applying to airlines,  <COREF ID="NEW80">the mediator</COREF>  may declare an impasse and begin a 30-day countdown, after  <COREF ID="NEW83">which management</COREF>  may unilaterally impose <COREF ID="37" REF="20">its</COREF> last contract offer and the union is free to strike. &quot;I dont believe there is any prospect of getting <COREF ID="38" REF="45">a negotiated settlement</COREF>,&quot; said <COREF ID="39" REF="38">Phil Bakes</COREF>, <COREF ID="40" REF="39">president and chief executive officer of Eastern</COREF>, &quot;until there is a firm date when the existing contract comes to an end.&quot; <COREF ID="43" REF="46">The union</COREF> says that <COREF ID="44" REF="27">it</COREF> is bargaining seriously and that each side has made  <COREF ID="NEW91">concessions</COREF> . <COREF ID="45" REF="31">A settlement through mediation</COREF> is possible, &quot;absolutely,&quot; said  <COREF ID="NEW93">Charles Bryan</COREF> , <COREF ID="46" REF="NEW93">head of the machinists union at Eastern</COREF>. &quot;<COREF ID="49" REF="26">I</COREF> have never called  <COREF ID="NEW94">a strike</COREF>  at <COREF ID="50" REF="53">Eastern</COREF>,&quot; <COREF ID="51" REF="79">he</COREF> said. Indeed, <COREF ID="52" REF="46">the Machinists union</COREF> -- as well as  <COREF ID="NEW95">the pilot</COREF>  and flight attendant unions at <COREF ID="53" REF="50">Eastern</COREF>, from whom <COREF ID="54" REF="NEW83">management</COREF> will also seek concessions in the coming months -- is anxious to avoid <COREF ID="55" REF="NEW94">a strike</COREF>. <COREF ID="56" REF="53">Eastern</COREF> has made elaborate preparations to keep <COREF ID="57" REF="65">the airline</COREF> flying with non-union workers. Even as <COREF ID="58" REF="74">talks</COREF> continue under <COREF ID="59" REF="78">Mr. Bickford</COREF>, neither side shows any sign of relenting in public. Last week, <COREF ID="60" REF="66">Eastern</COREF> ran newspaper advertising featuring  <COREF ID="NEW105">Frank Borman</COREF> , <COREF ID="61" REF="NEW105">the former astronaut and former Eastern president</COREF>, saying the federal investigation of Texas Air resulted from a union &quot;whisper campaign&quot; alleging <COREF ID="65" REF="57">the airline</COREF> is unsafe. A week earlier, <COREF ID="66" REF="60">Eastern</COREF> sued  <COREF ID="NEW108">the</COREF>  <COREF ID="67" REF="NEW108">Machinist</COREF> and <COREF ID="68" REF="NEW95">pilot unions</COREF>, accusing <COREF ID="69" REF="68">them</COREF> of a criminal conspiracy to drive down <COREF ID="70" REF="72">Texas Air</COREF>s stock price. <COREF ID="71" REF="66">Eastern</COREF> and <COREF ID="72" REF="70">Texas Air</COREF> are also urging employees and shareholders to write  <COREF ID="NEW113">their members</COREF>  of Congress demanding that <COREF ID="73" REF="NEW76">the National Mediation Board</COREF> begin the 30-day countdown in <COREF ID="74" REF="80">the talks</COREF>. And Thursday, about 3,000 <COREF ID="75" REF="52">union</COREF> members took part in a lunch-time demonstration in downtown Miami against <COREF ID="76" REF="72">Texas Air</COREF> and <COREF ID="77" REF="NEW70">Gov. Martinez</COREF>. <COREF ID="78" REF="59">Mr. Bickford</COREF> said <COREF ID="79" REF="83">he</COREF> was so upset by the level and tenor of the recent clamor, that <COREF ID="80" REF="74">the talks</COREF> were moved for a period in April from Miami, where Eastern is based, to Boston, where <COREF ID="83" REF="79">he</COREF> hoped things would be quieter. </TXT>
