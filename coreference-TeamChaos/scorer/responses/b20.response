After recent major price declines because of a sharp rise in OPEC production, <COREF ID="7" REF="88">total cartel output</COREF> has now dropped as much as one million barrels  <COREF ID="NEW13">a day</COREF>  -- from the years peak of 20 million barrels a day early this month. And there are new indications that even <COREF ID="10" REF="29">the United Arab Emirates</COREF>, <COREF ID="11" REF="10">OPECs most notable quota violator</COREF>, might soon cut its own output below a targeted 1.5 million barrels a day because of pressure from others in <COREF ID="15" REF="92">the cartel</COREF>, including Saudi Arabia. <COREF ID="16" REF="NEW44">The Emirates</COREF> arent making any promises publicly. But its government did offer conciliatory gestures to OPEC yesterday. <COREF ID="19" REF="NEW44">The gestures</COREF> followed the arrival in  <COREF ID="NEW27">Abu Dhabi</COREF>  of OPECs new secretary-general, <COREF ID="21" REF="22">Subroto</COREF>. <COREF ID="22" REF="NEW38">Mr. Subroto</COREF> delivered a letter to  <COREF ID="NEW30">Sheik Zayed Al Nahyyan</COREF> , <COREF ID="23" REF="29">the Emirates ruler</COREF>, from Rilwanu Lukman, <COREF ID="25" REF="40">Nigerias oil minister and OPECs president</COREF>, voicing concern over <COREF ID="29" REF="45">the Emirates</COREF> recent renunciation of its assigned quota of 948,000 barrels a day. The chief conciliatory note at the round of  <COREF ID="NEW37">talks</COREF>  with  <COREF ID="NEW38">Mr. Subroto</COREF>  came from <COREF ID="33" REF="NEW30">Sheik Zayed</COREF>, who &quot;reaffirmed&quot; the Emirates support for OPECs &quot;unity and cohesion.&quot; According to  <COREF ID="NEW39">the Emirates official news agency</COREF> , <COREF ID="37" REF="23">the ruler</COREF> also noted that <COREF ID="38">his country</COREF> &quot;has always been at the forefront for boosting <COREF ID="40" REF="10">OPEC</COREF> decisions and supporting the stability of the market.&quot;  <COREF ID="NEW44">The</COREF>  <COREF ID="41" REF="NEW39">news agency</COREF> report didnt mention <COREF ID="42" REF="29">the Emirates production level</COREF>. But senior oil officials in <COREF ID="45" REF="29">the Emirates</COREF> were quoted by Dow Jones International Petroleum Report <COREF ID="46" REF="82">yesterday</COREF> as saying that while <COREF ID="47" REF="NEW7">the government</COREF> isnt backing down on <COREF ID="48" REF="67">its</COREF> demand for a higher <COREF ID="49" REF="10">OPEC</COREF>  <COREF ID="NEW52">quota</COREF> , <COREF ID="50" REF="52">current production</COREF> is well under <COREF ID="51" REF="NEW7">the target</COREF>. Industry estimates generally place <COREF ID="52" REF="29">the Emirates current production</COREF> at between 1.2 million and 1.5 million barrels <COREF ID="54" REF="NEW13">a day</COREF>. Until recently, such excess output by the Emirates would have been ignored. But <COREF ID="56" REF="65">it</COREF> became an issue for <COREF ID="57" REF="10">OPEC</COREF> -- as well as for  <COREF ID="NEW60">the world oil markets</COREF>  -- last month, when Emirates officials went public with <COREF ID="60" REF="61">their</COREF> intent to renounce <COREF ID="61" REF="NEW52">their quota</COREF>.  <COREF ID="NEW65">That</COREF>  not only focused new attention on <COREF ID="63" REF="94">OPEC output</COREF>, which had begun climbing in late June, as previously reported, but <COREF ID="65" REF="56">it</COREF> also raised concern among other exporters. With Iraq also excluded from <COREF ID="66" REF="NEW7">the system</COREF> as a result of fallout from <COREF ID="67" REF="48">its</COREF>  <COREF ID="NEW72">war</COREF>  with Iran, &quot;<COREF ID="68">they</COREF> are afraid that if <COREF ID="69" REF="85">the UAE</COREF> continues outside there will be no control over <COREF ID="70" REF="NEW7">the others</COREF>,&quot; said Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-based consultant on <COREF ID="71" REF="10">OPEC</COREF> affairs. In addition to <COREF ID="72" REF="22">Mr. Subroto</COREF>s visit to <COREF ID="73" REF="NEW27">Abu Dhabi</COREF>, <COREF ID="74" REF="10">OPEC</COREF>s <COREF ID="75" REF="3">price</COREF>-monitoring committee of five leading <COREF ID="76" REF="NEW104">oil</COREF> ministers also is tentatively scheduled to meet next Wednesday in Lausanne, Switzerland, to address the problem of <COREF ID="77" REF="29">the Emirates</COREF> unilateral <COREF ID="78" REF="NEW52">quota</COREF> decision, and to review <COREF ID="79" REF="76">world oil prices</COREF>. But <COREF ID="81" REF="10">OPEC</COREF>s headquarters <COREF ID="82" REF="46">yesterday</COREF> still declined to confirm details of the meeting. &quot;<COREF ID="83">It</COREF>s tentative because <COREF ID="84" REF="56">it</COREF> depends on the outcome of <COREF ID="85" REF="NEW37">the talks in the UAE</COREF>,&quot; said an <COREF ID="87" REF="10">OPEC</COREF> spokesman. Meanwhile, <COREF ID="88" REF="40">total OPEC output</COREF> has dropped as much as 5% after <COREF ID="90" REF="NEW7">the recent run-up</COREF> -- with <COREF ID="91">Saudi Arabia</COREF>, <COREF ID="92" REF="15">the cartels biggest producer</COREF>, pacing the declines. PetroLogistics Ltd., a Geneva-based consulting firm that closely monitors <COREF ID="94" REF="63">OPEC output</COREF>, estimates production for July had averaged just over 19 million barrels a day after reaching <COREF ID="97" REF="NEW13">20 million barrels a day in the first week of the month</COREF>. <COREF ID="100" REF="NEW65">That</COREF>s in line with demand for <COREF ID="101" REF="10">OPEC</COREF>  <COREF ID="NEW104">oil</COREF>  for the second half, according to a current report on <COREF ID="102" REF="NEW60">world oil markets</COREF> by Charles L. McSpadden, <COREF ID="104" REF="106">manager of petroleum analysis</COREF>, and Antonio M. Szabo, <COREF ID="106" REF="104">manager of petroleum planning</COREF>, at Bonner @amp; Moore Market Consultants, Houston. &quot;<COREF ID="108" REF="NEW13">The 19 million barrels a day</COREF> is in <COREF ID="110" REF="10">OPEC</COREF>s comfort zone,&quot; said <COREF ID="111" REF="22">Mr. Szabo</COREF>. </TXT>
